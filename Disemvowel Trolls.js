/*Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.*/

function disemvowel(str) {
    let vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
    let array = str.split(' ')
    array.forEach((x, i) => array[i] = x.split('').filter(x => !vowels.includes(x)).join(''))
    return array.join(' ')
  }
